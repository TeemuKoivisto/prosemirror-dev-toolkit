# Roadmap

This is a loose list of features I'd like to implement into `prosemirror-dev-toolkit`.

- ~~track appendedTransactions. Because it's a must.~~
- show appendedTransactions in History tab & make it easier to access transactions
- fix missing borders for nodes in DocView
- add textarea to directly paste snapshots since importing files is cumbersome
- make panel adjustable in Structure tab between DocView and node info
- figure out why importing snapshots sometimes dont work after first failing to import
- special case for class-objects in svelte-tree-view
- ~~improve the injection script (basically enhance the hack to gain access to view)~~
- enhance structure tab on large docs. It could be faster
- add tab to execute commands. Basically a (primitive) prosemirror REPL
- make Chrome extension
- migrate to pnpm? need to workout the deployment flow with releases though first
- use css reset? just so styles are not affected by global stylesheets

No time schedules set. Just for reference for my and your's sake.
