# Roadmap

This is a loose list of features I'd like to implement into `prosemirror-dev-toolkit`.

- ~~track appendedTransactions. Because it's a must.~~
- ~~show appendedTransactions in History tab & make it easier to access transactions~~
- ~~fix missing borders for nodes in DocView~~
- ~~add textarea to directly paste snapshots since importing files is cumbersome~~
- make panel adjustable in Structure tab between DocView and node info
- figure out why importing snapshots sometimes dont work after first failing to import
- special case for class-objects in svelte-tree-view
- ~~improve the injection script (basically enhance the hack to gain access to view)~~
- enhance structure tab on large docs. It could be faster
- add tab to execute commands. Basically a (primitive) prosemirror REPL
- ~~make Chrome extension~~
- ~~migrate to pnpm? need to workout the deployment flow with releases though first~~
- ~~use css reset? just so styles are not affected by global stylesheets~~
- checkbox to filter empty/selection transactions
- OR just meta-key based filter of transactions
- switch Rollup to Vite (and maybe use PostCSS)
- ~~either upgrade Cypress or switch to say Playwright~~

No time schedules set. Just for reference for my and yours sake.
