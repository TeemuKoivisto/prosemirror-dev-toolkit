/**
 * Handler for dispatchTransaction that pushes trs to history and monkey patches applyTransaction
 *
 * Incase the editor already has a `dispatchTransaction` prop, oldDispatchFn is called but because
 * that function would also call state.apply we'd run apply multiple times, causing plugins to see
 * transactions often twice. So we monkey patch the `applyTransaction` method and apply some reflection
 * magic to maintain this-context as well as remove the patch if the transaction is somehow different
 * from the original.
 *
 * Why we have to monkey patch the method here and not once globally, is because the method is reset
 * to the original by ProseMirror at times so the function would not get called. Proxying `view.state.applyTransaction`
 * didn't also work.
 *
 * The other option is to use Plugins to store the transactions https://github.com/TeemuKoivisto/prosemirror-dev-toolkit/pull/15
 * which we'll revert to incase this one doesn't cover all the cases.
 * @param view
 * @param oldDispatchFn
 * @returns
